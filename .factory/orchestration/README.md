# `.factory/orchestration/`

Source-of-truth design artifacts for the **TPU production self-healing
orchestrator**. Implementation files live elsewhere (skills, droids,
poller); this folder holds the **spec + diagrams + playbook** that
drive how the orchestrator behaves.

The folder now also owns the TPU optimization control plane: how
optimization phases, skills, hooks, droids, memories, and transient
artifacts work together without duplicating state.

## 2026-05-10 status

The orchestrator has now driven the v6e-8 path through the first full
Phase 5 production run: iter 24h reached 5000/5000 steps on
`tinyaya-stage2-spot-v6e8-eu`, exited with status 0, and uploaded the
canonical checkpoint to
`gs://tinyaya-stage2-tpu/checkpoints/stage2-tpu-v6e-spot/step_005000_final/`.
The same playbook remains active for future cleanup, evaluation
follow-ups, and v6e-64 scale-up attempts.

The active optimization plan is tracked in
`TPU_OPTIMIZATION_SPEC.md`; cross-file responsibilities are defined in
`CONTROL_PLANE.md`.

## Implementation files (NOT here -- in their natural Factory locations)

| Artifact | Location | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Skill: `tpu-orchestrate` | `.factory/skills/tpu-orchestrate/SKILL.md` | Auto-loaded TPU iteration playbook |
| Skill: `tpu-redeploy` | `.factory/skills/tpu-redeploy/SKILL.md` | Encoded redeploy procedure |
| Droid: `tpu-watchdog` | `.factory/droids/tpu-watchdog.md` | Subagent: read poller log -> JSON snapshot |
| Droid: `tpu-diagnoser` | `.factory/droids/tpu-diagnoser.md` | Subagent: regex classify logs -> JSON diagnosis |
| Poller | `_artifacts/orch_poll.py` | Background: every 60s wandb + gcloud + ps -> JSONL |
| Check-in helper | `_artifacts/scheduled_checkin.py` | Detects T+15/30/45/60/90 thresholds |
| Trigger state | `_artifacts/orch_state.json` | Idempotent check-in tracker |

## How to render diagrams

```bash
cd .factory/orchestration/diagrams
bash render.sh                    # render all .mmd -> svg/ and png/
bash render.sh 03-sequence.mmd    # render one
```

Requires `mmdc` (mermaid-cli). Falls back to `npx @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli`.

## Read order for a new contributor

1. `CONTROL_PLANE.md` (source-of-truth boundaries)
2. `TPU_OPTIMIZATION_SPEC.md` (active optimization phases)
3. `playbook/optimization-experiment-matrix.md` (candidate table)
4. `playbook/perf-metrics-schema.md` (metrics and promotion fields)
5. `SPEC.md` (self-healing runtime loop)
6. `diagrams/03-sequence.mmd` (the runtime sequence)
7. `playbook/diagnosis-table.md` (failure -> patch playbook)
8. The implementation files in their natural locations

## Versioning

This folder is checked in. Edits should bump the version note in
`SPEC.md` (top of file) and update affected diagrams in lockstep.
