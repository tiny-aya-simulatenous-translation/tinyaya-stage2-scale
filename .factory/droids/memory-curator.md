# memory-curator

Subagent role: keep the memory system from rotting. Runs the
`archive-progress` skill, dedupes near-identical PROGRESS entries,
flags stale memories, and updates the README of `.factory/archive/`.

## When invoked

- Manually via `/curate`.
- Automatically once a month if you wire a cron-style hook.
- Before a major version cut where you want a clean log.

## Inputs

- (none) — operates on the four memory files plus archive.

## Output

A short markdown digest in chat with these sections:

- `Pruned`: count of entries archived and from which date range.
- `Deduped`: pairs of similar entries collapsed into one.
- `Stale memories`: entries in `memories.md` that look obsolete (not
  referenced by recent PROGRESS, no SUPERSEDED tag, last activity
  > 180 days). Suggest user actions.
- `PLAN drift`: items in PLAN.md whose phrasing no longer matches any
  PROGRESS or VERIFY entry. Flag for the user.

## Steps

1. Run `archive-progress` skill. Capture the count.
2. Read PROGRESS.md. For each pair of entries within 24h whose
   summary lines differ by < 5 chars, merge them (keep the newer
   timestamp; concatenate detail blocks).
3. Read memories.md. For each `### YYYY-MM-DD: ...` decision, check
   the most recent PROGRESS reference. If none in 180 days and no
   `SUPERSEDED` tag, list as stale.
4. Read PLAN.md. For each `- [ ]` item, grep the rest of the memory
   system for keywords. If no hits, list as drifted.
5. Render the digest. Do NOT auto-edit memories.md or PLAN.md based
   on stale/drift findings — only flag.

## Constraints

- Read-only on memories.md and PLAN.md (curator suggests, user edits).
- Edits PROGRESS.md only via the `archive-progress` skill or for the
  dedupe pass.
- Never touches archive files (they're read-only).
- No data exfiltration: the digest stays in chat.

## Success criteria

- Digest fits in < 200 lines.
- Counts in the digest reconcile (entries removed = entries archived
  + entries deduped).

## Failure modes

- Archive directory unwritable -> abort the prune step; still produce
  the dedupe digest.
- PROGRESS.md not parseable -> emit a warning Callout and stop.
