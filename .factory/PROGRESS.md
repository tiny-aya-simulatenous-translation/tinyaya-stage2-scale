Repository verification passed after iter 24h documentation and checkpoint-status updates.

Details:
- `.factory/VERIFY.md`: all 19 fenced bash blocks passed.
- TPU sharding probes were skipped because `PJRT_DEVICE` is unset on
  the workstation, as intended.
- Focused simultaneous-translation ruff validators passed:
  `ruff format --check src/ scripts/` and `ruff check src/ scripts/`.
- Verification fixes included excluding `.venv` from the secrets grep
  and lazily importing the Phase 3 `PipelineConfig` so
  `python3 cli.py --help` works even when optional pipeline modules are
  unavailable.

Iter 24h completed the first 5000-step v6e-8 production run and uploaded the final canonical checkpoint.

Details:
- W&B run: https://wandb.ai/cataluna84/tinyaya-stage2-tpu/runs/7rrjupc7
  (`v6e-spot-stage2-5k-iter24h`).
- Training reached step 5000/5000 and exited with status 0 at
  2026-05-10T01:47:24Z after 615.9 min.
- Final step line:
  `loss 5.3558 | text 10.3176 audio 4.3240 | 6.96s/step`.
- No NaN, OOM, RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED, fatal, traceback, bus-error, or
  kernel-panic signals were found in `/tmp/train.log`.
- Canonical final save completed and uploaded to
  `gs://tinyaya-stage2-tpu/checkpoints/stage2-tpu-v6e-spot/step_005000_final/`.
- GCS listing shows 8 objects / 2.37 GiB:
  `metadata.json`, `text_embed.pt`, `depth_decoder.pt`,
  `projection.pt`, `audio_heads.pt`, and PEFT adapter files.
- XLA compilation was startup-only: 18 compilation causes total, 12
  before visible step 1 and 6 around steps 1-2; no late recompiles
  through step 5000.

Iter 24h closes the remaining step-259 grad-accum epoch-boundary graph gap and uploads a fresh tarball.

Details:
- Exa/XLA evidence reinforced that HLO changes on input-shape or
  value-dependent branch changes; PyTorch/XLA #8616 also highlights that
  gradient accumulation wants a fixed [GA, batch, ...] topology.
- Added TPU host-side batch-axis padding in InterleavedCollator
  (`batch_pad_to`, `expected_num_codebooks`).
- Changed TPU DataLoader back to drop_last=False; tail rows are padded
  with zero attention/loss masks instead of dropped.
- Added macro-step guard so epoch reset happens only between optimizer
  steps, never inside a 4-way grad-accum graph.
- Kept iter24g SDPA mask-elision disable.
- Uploaded gs://tinyaya-stage2-tpu/code/tinyaya-repo-iter24h.tar.gz.
- Validators passed for simultaneous-translation: ruff format/check,
  py_compile all tracked Python, YAML parse, bash -n TPU scripts +
  launcher.

Second user-approved v6e-8 retry preempted during iter24g compile; no step was reached.

Details:
- Patched startup_script.sh to include the same stable TPU env as the
  manual launcher (flash disabled, PT_XLA_DEBUG_LEVEL=1) and ulimit
  1048576, then refreshed the iter24g tarball in GCS.
- Recreated v6e-8 spot QR again; startup completed and manual launcher
  started iter24g.
- W&B run was created:
  https://wandb.ai/cataluna84/tinyaya-stage2-tpu/runs/kmvydrq1
- Runtime reached compile (`Graph Hash: 6be815b64f...`) with 0 NaN/OOM
  signals and no loss lines yet.
- TPU was preempted during first compile; QR=SUSPENDED/SERVICE and
  node=PREEMPTED. No iter24g training step reached.

Approved v6e-8 QR recreate succeeded, but the replacement spot TPU preempted before iter 24g could launch.

Details:
- Deleted stale preempted QR/node and recreated
  tinyaya-stage2-spot-v6e8-eu-qr with iter24g tarball metadata.
- QR reached ACTIVE/READY, then startup failed once because the tarball
  omitted root README.md required by hatchling.
- Rebuilt and re-uploaded iter24g tarball including README.md.
- Before manual redeploy could complete, node returned to PREEMPTED and
  QR to SUSPENDED (SERVICE).
- No iter24g W&B run was created; no training step ran on the replacement.

Iter 24g patch + tarball are ready, but the v6e-8 TPU node is terminal PREEMPTED.

Details:
- Exa/XLA evidence points to a step-259 graph-topology change from dynamic
  batch/mask branches.
- Patched train_hierarchical.py to use TPU drop_last=True, static-shape
  assertions, and disabled HF SDPA attention-mask elision.
- Updated stage2_tpu_v6e_spot.yaml and launcher to iter24g.
- Uploaded gs://tinyaya-stage2-tpu/code/tinyaya-repo-iter24g.tar.gz.
- Focused validators passed: py_compile, YAML parse, bash -n, ruff format
  check, ruff check.
- tpu-watchdog verdict=crashed: node tinyaya-stage2-spot-v6e8-eu is
  PREEMPTED and cannot be used; do not auto-recreate QR without approval.

patch 19 staged: end-of-training canonical save (HF #36004 fix)

Root-cause confirmed via Exa research (HF transformers issues #36004,
#29388, #29659): `PEFT.save_pretrained` does NOT support saving
models that are still resident on a TPU device, even when a CPU
state_dict is passed via `state_dict=peft_state` kwarg. The function
internally re-walks the model's submodules (named_parameters /
state_dict introspection inside get_peft_model_state_dict), which on
an FSDPv2-wrapped XLA model triggers SPMD collectives that can never
complete because only host 0 entered the function. Patches 14/16/17
materializing CPU state_dicts on every host were necessary but not
sufficient -- the deadlock is INSIDE save_pretrained itself.

Canonical fix (HF #36004 closed Dec 2025):
    model.to("cpu")           # SPMD gather; ALL hosts call this
    unwrap_model(model).save_pretrained(...)  # now CPU; no XLA hooks

`model.to("cpu")` moves the entire wrapped model onto host RAM in
one collective. After that, save_pretrained walks an ordinary CPU
module with no XLA tensors involved. Trade-off: this is destructive
to FSDPv2 sharding metadata, so we can only invoke it ONCE at the
final step (training cannot continue afterward).

Implementation:
- new `save_checkpoint_canonical_final(model, save_dir, *, is_main)`
  in `src/training/checkpointing.py` -- moves all 5 sub-modules
  (backbone.model, projection, depth_decoder, text_embed,
  audio_heads) to CPU on every host, rendezvous, then host 0 writes
  files via `save_pretrained(safe_serialization=True)` + `torch.save`.
- wired into `scripts/train_hierarchical.py` end-of-training block,
  gated on `cfg.train.final_canonical_save` (default false).
- DEFAULT DISABLED for iter 12 per user direction "validate step 200
  first; fix saves later". Will be enabled for iter 13.

py_compile + ruff clean on both files.

spot v4-32 QR preempted by SERVICE during iter 11

`tinyaya-stage2-spot-v4-canary-qr` flipped to
`state=SUSPENDED;stateInitiator=SERVICE` while iter 11 was at T+9
(still in compile). All 4 worker VMs returned NOT_FOUND.

Tier 3 escalation per `tpu-orchestrate` skill. Committed dccb7a1
(13 files, +2300 lines) to preserve work. Started backgrounded
QR poller (`_artifacts/qr_resume_poll.sh`, PID 17201) -- polls
every 60s, will append `>>> RESUMED <<<` once state flips to
ACTIVE.

Resuming iter 12+ on QR resurrection.

TPU canary v4-32 spot reached step 100 with decreasing loss (iter 7).
First end-to-end Stage 2 success; all SPMD + observability + recompile
fixes validated.

Run: `https://wandb.ai/cataluna84/tinyaya-stage2-tpu/runs/8pse8tzk`
Loss: step 10 = 9.0273 -> step 100 = 7.5983 (decreasing).
Steady-state: 3.41 sec/step from step 30 onwards.
All 4 hosts attached to one wandb umbrella (shared-mode).

Patches that landed (4-11):
- p4: `optimizer_step` strategy-aware (FSDPv2 path: `optimizer.step()`
  + `mark_step()`, replicated path: `xm.optimizer_step()`).
- p5: `xm.mark_step()` before grad clip on TPU.
- p6: skip `clip_grad_norm_` on TPU (FSDPv2 sharded grads + clip norm
  forces a graph break per micro step).
- p7: replace `.item()` with `.detach()` in TPU inner loop; XLA-tensor
  accumulators (`micro_loss_sum_xla`); single materialize at
  log_every. Eliminates the cpu_fallback storm that misdiagnosed iter
  1/2 as "deadlock" (was actually 8 sequential 12-16 min compiles).
- p8: cross-host `is_main_process` =
  `xr.host_index()==0 AND xm.is_master_ordinal()`. Prevents 4 separate
  wandb runs.
- p9: wandb shared-mode rendezvous via GCS
  (`gs://tinyaya-stage2-tpu/wandb-rendezvous/v4-32-spot-canary.id`).
  Worker 0 publishes run_id, workers 1-3 attach via `gsutil cat` retry
  loop (60 x 5s) using `mode=shared, x_primary, x_label=rank_N`.
  Requires wandb >= 0.19.9 (TPU image ships 0.19.11).
- p10: `grad_accum: 2 -> 8` -> hit HBM OOM at iter 4 (34.16G / 31.75G
  by 2.41G).
- p10b: `grad_accum: 8 -> 4` -> hit HBM OOM at iter 5 (over by 41 MB,
  tantalizingly close; static memory dominated, not activations).
- p10c: `grad_accum: 4 -> 2` (revert to iter 3 wiring with patch 7
  fix) -> iter 6 reached step 2 but hit per-batch recompile.
- p11: `collator pad_to=cfg.data.max_frames` (300) on TPU eliminates
  per-batch shape variation. Canonical fix per pytorch/xla
  recompilation guide. Iter 7 reached step 100, sec/step settled to
  3.41 after the warm-up window.
- p12 + p13 (drafted but not yet validated): skip
  `generate_audio_sample` and `run_validation` on TPU during canary;
  they re-trigger XLA recompiles by feeding non-canonical shapes
  through the model.

Iteration timeline (wall-clock minutes-from-deploy):
| Iter | Patches | Outcome | Notes |
|------|---------|---------|-------|
| 1 | (initial) | Misdiagnosed "deadlock" at T+71 | actually compile of `.item()` cpu_fallback storm |
| 2 | FSDPv2 (4,5,6) | Same symptom | confirmed `.item()` was forcing 12-16 min compile each |
| 3 | + 7 (.item() removal) | Compile completed | 4 separate wandb runs (1 per host) |
| 4 | + 8/9/10 (cross-host + shared wandb + grad_accum=8) | OOM at T+76 | 34.16G / 31.75G by 2.41G; fused HLO too large |
| 5 | grad_accum=4 | OOM by 41 MB | static memory dominated; activations not the bottleneck |
| 6 | grad_accum=2 | Step 2 reached | per-batch shape recompiles burned cycles |
| 7 | + 11 (fixed-shape padding to max_frames=300) | **STEP 100, loss decreasing** | sec/step 3.41 steady-state |
| 8 | + 12/13 (skip audio val + run_validation on TPU) | drafted | reduces per-step recompile risk |

Stack diagnostics validated (py-spy 0.4.2 + /proc/PID/stack):
- Real Python PID is the python3 process (not the `uv run` parent;
  `uv run` sleeps).
- Native stack `xla::PjRtCApiClient::CompileAndLoad ->
  InitializeArgsAndCompile -> libtpu.so` = healthy compile, not stall.
- Native stack containing `cpu_fallback / _local_scalar_dense /
  at::native::item` = anti-pattern; redirect to patch 7.

Cross-host SPMD lessons:
- `xr.host_index()` returns 0..N-1 across hosts; `xm.is_master_ordinal
  ()` is local-to-host. Only `host_index==0 AND
  is_master_ordinal()` is the global rank-0.
- wandb shared-mode requires >=0.19.9 (`mode=shared`, `x_primary=True`
  on rank-0, `x_label=rank_N` on others). GCS rendezvous is a
  dependency-free way to share the run_id.

Self-healing orchestrator (Phase 1 commit ee01024) exit metrics:
- Iterations consumed: 8 (5 hot-redeploys without QR re-create).
- Wall-clock total: ~6 hours.
- QRs created: 1 (preserved across iter 1-8).
- Tier-3 escalations: 0.
- User check-ins: 5 (T+15/30/45/60/T+71-deadlock-misdiag, T+63-iter4).

- Explicit gradient checkpointing enabled; per-chip HBM usage
- `canary` config restored to `max_frames=300`,
- `fsdpv2_lora` strategy runs **at least 50 successful training
- All commands in `VERIFY.md` pass.
- First successful checkpoint written to GCS and W&B run logged.
- 5000-step run completes; final loss + ASR-BLEU recorded in
- Re-run probe with the real model on `tiny_canary` config; confirm

TRC quota table refreshed from the original welcome email; falling
back to spot v4-32 in `us-central2-b` because on-demand v4 in that
same zone is currently busy.

- Authoritative quota now lives in
  `simultaneous-translation/docs/tpu-trc-allocation.md` (verbatim
  from `trc-support@google.com` email to `mayankbhaskar007@gmail.com`,
  project `ml-pipelines-315702`, 90-day window).
- Old 5-row table in `docs/tpu-launch-plan.md` §2 marked SUPERSEDED.
- Default spot launch profile: `TRC_PROFILE=v4-32-uc2b`. Same zone /
  IAM / VPC / runtime as the on-demand path; only `--spot` differs.
- Phase 3 / 4 / 5 will run against the spot v4-32 via
  `scripts/tpu/launch_spot.sh` + the new
  `configs/stage2_tpu_canary_v4_spot.yaml` and
  `configs/stage2_tpu_v4_spot.yaml`.

TPU canary + production code path landed; doc convention applied
across `src/` + `scripts/`.

- Phase 1+2 (PLAN.md): `scan_layers` + `xla_grad_checkpoint` wrappers
  shipped in `src/model/scan_utils.py`; both flags exposed on
  `composite.TinyAyaMoshiComposite` and threaded through
  `scripts/train_hierarchical.py` DEFAULTS.
- Phase 4 (canary fidelity): `configs/stage2_tpu_canary.yaml`
  restored to `max_frames=300`, `depth_chunk_size=16`; both
  `train.use_scan_layers` and `train.xla_grad_checkpoint` are `true`.
- Phase 5 prep: `configs/stage2_tpu.yaml` matches the canary on the
  two new flags; `launch_qr.sh` already plumbs `TPU_STRATEGY` via the
  queued-resource metadata.
- Documentation pass: every `*.py` under `src/` + `scripts/` now uses
  the `WHY THIS EXISTS` + NumPy-docstring convention codified in
  `simultaneous-translation/AGENTS.md` ("TPU code documentation style
  (mandatory)") and the `.factory/skills/tpu-doc-style/SKILL.md` skill.
- Lint + verify: `ruff format --check`, `ruff check` clean across
  `src/` + `scripts/`. `py_compile` clean on every `.py`,
  `yaml.safe_load` clean on every config, `bash -n` clean on every
  shell script. Pre-existing `phase-3-data-generation-pipeline/cli.py`
  `src.config` import error remains out of scope.
- Pending (need live TPU): probe-strategy decision, 5-step + 50-step
  canary, and the 5000-step Phase 5 launch -- runbook delivered to
  the user.

Tarball compare-and-contrast: all 13 changed files byte-identical
between local working tree and extracted tarball. Sizes match
(415920 b local / 483071 b GCS post-rebuild).

fsdpv2_lora compile on real composite (5.17B params) hit 15+ minutes
without progress. Process at 35GB CPU RSS, 440% CPU, futex_wait stack.
Likely cause: 36 CohereDecoderLayer + 6 MoshiDecoderLayer unrolled
into single HLO graph. Mitigation: scan_layers (pending).

## 2026-05-03T14:00:00Z | feat/tpu-support@a00c11b | fail | exec
replicated strategy OOM on real composite: HBM used 25.90GB / limit
15.75GB on v5litepod-16. Mitigation: switch to fsdpv2_lora.

## 2026-05-03T13:30:00Z | feat/tpu-support@a00c11b | done | decide
Cast model to `torch.bfloat16` inside `wrap_model` instead of relying
on `XLA_USE_BF16` (deprecated in torch_xla 2.6+). See
`memories.md` for rationale.

## 2026-05-03T13:00:00Z | feat/tpu-support@a00c11b | done | exec
Probe results on live v5litepod-16 (tiny stand-in model):

| strategy     | compile (s) | step (s) |
|--------------|-------------|----------|
| replicated   | 0.91        | 0.004    |
| fsdpv2_lora  | 0.95        | 0.027    |
| fsdpv2       | 0.97        | 0.052    |

All three strategies validated; partitioner crash from pytorch/xla
#8607 confirmed fixed by `XLA_DISABLE_FUNCTIONALIZATION=0`.

## 2026-05-03T12:00:00Z | feat/tpu-support@a00c11b | done | edit
Added `src/backend/tpu_backend.py` multi-strategy backend with
`TPU_STRATEGY` env var (replicated / fsdpv2 / fsdpv2_lora / auto).
Added `diagnose()`, `mark_sharding()` to base.py.

## 2026-05-03T11:00:00Z | feat/tpu-support@a00c11b | done | edit
Added `scripts/tpu/probe_strategies.py`,
`scripts/tpu/hot_redeploy.sh`, `scripts/tpu/_remote_redeploy.sh`.
Sub-3-minute redeploy without QR re-create.

## Next steps (rolled forward by SessionEnd)

- Implement `scan_layers` around `CohereDecoderLayer` (36 backbone
  layers) and `MoshiDecoderLayer` (6 depth-decoder layers) to compile
  one layer's HLO and reuse it. Should cut compile from 25+ min to
  a few min.
- Add explicit gradient checkpointing for forward activation memory.
- Re-test `fsdpv2_lora` compile time with `scan_layers` enabled.
- Restore canary `max_frames` from 64 back to 300 once compile is fast.
- Run full 5000-step training and confirm checkpointing + W&B logging.

### 2026-05-08 04:15 UTC | feat/tpu-support | patch-19-validation

**Status:** SUCCESS
**Kind:** milestone
**Detail:**
Patch 19 (canonical end-of-training save) validated on v6e-8 single-host
europe-west4-a. Training completed 20 steps (fp32, batch=1, accum=2) with
loss 9.94 -> 8.78 (decreasing). The canonical save executed successfully:
`model.to("cpu")` gathered all FSDPv2 shards onto host RAM without deadlock,
then `save_pretrained(safe_serialization=False)` wrote all components.
Checkpoint artifacts confirmed:
  - peft_adapter/adapter_model.bin (7 MB, LoRA adapters)
  - peft_adapter/adapter_config.json (LoRA config)
  - projection.pt (16 MB), depth_decoder.pt (1.4 GB),
    text_embed.pt (1.0 GB), audio_heads.pt (8 MB)
  - metadata.json {"step": "final", "save_kind": "canonical_final"}
  - Total: 2.4 GB

Known issue: save_dir was set to a gs:// URI, but torch.save wrote to a
local directory named `gs:/...` instead of actual GCS. Need to add a
post-save gsutil cp step or use gcsfs.

Earlier in this session:
  - v6e-8 in us-east1-d: preempted during maintenance event
  - v6e-8 in us-east1-d (2nd attempt): SUSPENDED for 28 min, no recovery
  - v6e-8 in europe-west4-a: ACTIVE at T+4:44 (fastest yet)
  - v6e bf16 NaN at step 1: diagnosed as pytorch/xla #4152 (HF attention
    mask torch.finfo(fp32).min -> -inf in bf16) + #8591 (v6e-specific
    batch-size-dependent NaN). Fixed by switching to float32 precision.
  - "Too many open files" crash: systemd startup_script inherited
    LimitNOFILE=100000. Fixed by launching via explicit `ulimit -n 1048576`
    in a dedicated launcher script (/tmp/launch_train_v6e_v2.sh).
  - fd limit root cause: v6e 8-chip topology + libtpu eventfd interrupts
    create ~100k FDs during init, exceeding default ulimit. The systemd-
    managed startup_script had LimitNOFILE=100000 but tmux child inherited
    a lower limit.
